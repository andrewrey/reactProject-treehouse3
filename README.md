Scoreboard App continuation using context api: Part of TeamTreeHouse Context API Workshop




**TeamTreeHouse Scoreboard: Workshop Context API**
This Workshop is a continuation from the previous TeamTreeHouse React Basics course. It continues to cover the following topics, but this time uses the Create-React-App and the Context API to build the scoreboard.

Topics Covered
 1. React.createContext()
 2. Provider
 3. Consumer 
 4. Render Props / Function as a child

The focus here is to change how the state is passed to components. Instead of using the props to carry the data several layers down, it uses the Context API to pass data between the Provider and Consumer.
